If the image is internal (you want a location relative
 to your project, or perhaps packaged into your jar),
do what mad programmer said:

iconX = new ImageIcon(getClass().getResource("/path/imageX.png"))

The path is relative, so path/
 will be a folder in the same folder as your project (or packaged into your jar).

If you want an external image, simply hand ImageIcon constructor the path (ex. "C:/.../file.png").
 This isn't recommended though, as it's better to use it as a resource.
